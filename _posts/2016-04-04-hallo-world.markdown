After a few years of a blogging hiatus, I feel once again the need (the need for
speed, pardon my childish wordplay) to write about things that are going on in
front our very eyes, but few people seem to care about or even notice at all.
This is not a blog, as in weblogging my personal/hacking life and achievements.
This is a thought exercise, so I can write my thoughts in a more constructed
manner.

Although, it would be an interesting turn of events, if some of my writings,
inspire or affect other people in any way. Given the increasing noise that we're
receiving from the Internet, small contributions of ideas that matter
nonetheless, eventually become a drop in the ocean, never to be read or found
again.

Nonetheless, there are some issues that humanity faces today, that are so
important about our future, that should be discussed no matter the outcome. We
tend to concentrate on nieche problems, like "an app that helps me organize with my
friends to go out tongiht" or a webservice that will just deliver fresh goods to my
doorstep without me getting off my screen-based life and go out, walk three
blocks to the supermarket. Does this sound convenient to me?

*Abso-freaking-lutely*.

But the important question is...

> At what cost?

You see everything comes at a cost. Whether it is energy, money, physical or
mental labour, you have some physical limitations in the game engine of this
world. But most people don't think about these implications. And I'm not
referring exclusively to uneducated people. There are some brilliant
scientists out there, and many of them are either asking the wrong questions
or giving wrong answers. Or maybe they just can't see the forest for the trees.
Blinded by intuition, dogmas & corporate sponsorships, it eventually becomes
blurry what is science all about. At some point in history, human species stopped
asking questions and started watching the news.

But because we live in a technocratic world, we should approach these problems
as a whole. Not only by the technical point of view, but looking at those
problems though the social prism.

And that's because technology cannot be controlled by mystic organizations and shady
federal agencies. It evolves in time, much like humans evolved during hundrends
of aeons.  And it may be creating problems along the way, but it sure as hell
fixes a lot of stuff as well.

Are we in control though of our technology, or we got it the other way around?
